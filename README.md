# DataMining

## Project Overview

For financial institutions, credit risk assessment is a crucial task that enables them to distinguish between "good" and "bad" customersâ€”in other words, to determine whether an applicant is eligible for credit. The development of machine learning techniques in recent years has significantly improved this selection process.

The aim of this project is twofold. Firstly, it involves describing and performing exploratory data analysis on the 'German Credit Data' dataset to maximize insight into the dataset and its structure. Secondly, using the knowledge gained from this analysis, different data mining techniques will be employed to classify bank customers as 'good' or 'bad.' These classification models will be compared to select the best one, with the goal of increasing the efficiency of predicting whether a given customer is suitable for credit.
